scholar.py
----------

The scholar.py script is used by bibdl. Here's an excerpt of its readme:
  """
  scholar.py is a Python module that implements a querier and parser for Google Scholar's output. Its classes can be used independently, but it can also be invoked as a command-line tool.

   The script used to live at http://icir.org/christian/scholar.html, and I've moved it here so I can more easily manage the various patches and suggestions I'm receiving for scholar.py. Thanks guys, for all your interest! If you'd like to get in touch, email me at christian@icir.org or ping me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/ckreibich).
scholar.py

  Cheers,<br>
  Christian
